Query extension is added in Query directory instead of extensions folder so that changes are additive only
and can be applied to other extensions with minimal change

## Extending the Schema

Query extension can be use to extend events, objects, attributes of any of the namespace schema.
namespace is an optional attribute in events, objects, includes which can be added to extend an extension's schema.
Query Extensions have additional categories, event classes, attributes, objects or profiles. 
Existing categories, events, attributes, objects or profile can also be modified although we should minimize it for better forward compatibility.
