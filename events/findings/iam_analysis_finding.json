  "description": "This finding represents an IAM analysis result, which evaluates IAM policies, access patterns, and IAM configurations for potential security risks. The analysis can focus on either an identity (user, role, service account) or a resource to assess permissions, access patterns, and security posture within the IAM domain. <br><strong>Note:</strong>If the event producer is a security control, the <code>security_control</code> profile should be applied and its <code>attacks</code> information, if present, should be duplicated into the <code>finding_info</code> object. <br><strong>Note:</strong>If the Finding is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the <code>incident</code> profile or aggregate this finding into an <code>Incident Finding</code>.",
