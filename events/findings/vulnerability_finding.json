Note: if the event producer is a security control, the <code>security_control</code> profile should be applied and its <code>attacks</code> information, if present, should be duplicated into the <code>finding_info</code> object. <br><strong>Note: </strong>If the Finding is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the <code>incident</code> profile  or aggregate this finding into an <code>Incident Finding</code>.",
