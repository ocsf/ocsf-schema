These detections or alerts can be created using fingerprinting, statistical analysis, machine learning or other methodologies. The finding describes the actors and endpoints who accessed or own the sensitive data, as well as the resources which store the sensitive data. Note: if the event producer is a security control, the <code>security_control</code> profile should be applied and its <code>attacks</code> information, if present, should be duplicated into the <code>finding_info</code> object. <br><strong>Note: </strong>If the Finding is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the <code>incident</code> profile  or aggregate this finding into an <code>Incident Finding</code>.",
