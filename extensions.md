# OCSF Extensions Registry
The purpose of this file is to keep track of extensions and their uid's, so we
can avoid extension name and uid collisions.

| Caption     | Name   | UID | Notes |

| AWS         | aws_ex | **2** | The Amazon AWS schema extension |
| Development | dev    | **999** | The development (TODO) schema extensions |
