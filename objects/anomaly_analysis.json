  "description": "Describes the analysis of activity patterns and anomalies of a target entity to identify potential security threats, performance issues, or other deviations from established baselines. This includes monitoring and analyzing user interactions, API usage, resource utilization, access patterns and other measured indicators.",

This could be a specific User Account, Kubernetes Cluster, Network namespace, Application component, or any other discrete unit of the system where patterns can be meaningfully analyzed. The target defines the boundary of what activities are being monitored and analyzed.",

This can include unusual access patterns, unexpected user-agents, abnormal API usage, suspicious traffic spikes, unauthorized access attempts, and other activities that may indicate potential security threats or system issues.",
