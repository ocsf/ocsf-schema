  "description": "The Token object contains attributes for API tokens, client tokens, and API keys used specifically for API authentication and authorization. Use this object in API activity events to represent: (1) tokens created by Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Okta API tokens or Microsoft Entra ID Application Registration client secrets, (2) generic API keys used in SaaS applications for API authentication. When to use this object: Use <code>token</code> when you need to represent the token used to authenticate an API request in an API activity event. When NOT to use this object: Do NOT use <code>token</code> for protocol-specific authentication tokens (Kerberos TGT/ST, OIDC ID/Refresh tokens, SAML assertions) - use <code>authentication_token</code> instead in authentication events. Do NOT use <code>token</code> for tracking credential lifecycle and usage patterns - use <code>programmatic_credential</code> instead.",
